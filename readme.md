Starting date: 11/22/2021

TYPE OF GAME: 2d Breakout game

- The player will be controlling a platform on the bottom of the page in which they can go left or right.
  With this paltform they're supposed to prevent the ball from balling, once the ball hits the platform its supposed to bounce against it and hit targets on the opposite side of
  the game. Every target that gets hit will add points to the total score. The targets will slowly move towards the platform and if the targets reach the platform then the user loses.
  If all the targets are destroyed then the user wins.
